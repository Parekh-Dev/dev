## 🎬 DURING INTERVIEW

### Opening (First 2 minutes)
- [ ] Make eye contact and smile
- [ ] Give firm handshake (if in-person)
- [ ] Show enthusiasm: "Thanks for having me!"
- [ ] Take a seat and get comfortable
- [ ] Have pen ready for taking notes

### When they ask "Tell us about your project"
- [ ] **Don't rush** - Take a breath
- [ ] **Start with one sentence**: "NoteFlow-AI is an AI-powered note-taking app with encryption and smart features"
- [ ] **Ask clarifying question**: "Would you like me to do a quick demo first, or should I explain the architecture?"
- [ ] **Wait for their response**

### During Demo (5-7 minutes)
- [ ] Keep screen zoomed in so they can see clearly
- [ ] **Speak out loud** as you demo (don't just click silently)
- [ ] Point at features: "So here you can see..."
- [ ] Click slowly and deliberately (not too fast)
- [ ] Create a note
- [ ] Show encryption feature
- [ ] Show AI translation
- [ ] Show summarization

### When they ask a technical question
- [ ] **Pause for 3 seconds** (think before speaking)
- [ ] **Ask clarifying question** if needed: "Do you mean...?"
- [ ] **Start simple** then go deeper: "Well, at a basic level... and the deeper point is..."
- [ ] **Use whiteboard/paper** if possible: "Can I draw this?"
- [ ] **Show your thinking**: "My approach would be..."

### If you don't know something
- [ ] **Don't make it up**
- [ ] Say: "That's a great question. I haven't done that yet, but here's how I'd approach it..."
- [ ] **Show problem-solving thinking** even if you don't know the answer
- [ ] **Offer to research** it: "Could I look into that and get back to you?"

### When they give you a coding task
- [ ] **Read the problem carefully** - Ask them to repeat if needed
- [ ] **Clarify scope**: "Do you want just the logic or full implementation?"
- [ ] **Think out loud**: "So the issue is X, I'd solve it by Y because..."
- [ ] **Pseudocode first** if you're not sure: "First I'd do this, then this..."
- [ ] **Don't try to be perfect** - Just show your approach
- [ ] **Test your logic**: "So that would handle case X and case Y..."

### Handling Different Question Types

**"Tell me about your tech stack"**
- [ ] Answer: "Next.js for frontend, React for UI, Context API for state, localStorage for persistence, Groq API for AI, Vercel for hosting"

**"Why did you choose X over Y?"**
- [ ] Answer with trade-offs: "I chose X because... but Y would be better for... because..."

**"What would you improve?"**
- [ ] Have 3 answers ready:
  - [ ] 1. Database instead of localStorage
  - [ ] 2. Authentication for multi-user
  - [ ] 3. Real-time sync with WebSockets

**"How does encryption work?"**
- [ ] Use your paper: Draw diagram
- [ ] Explain CryptoJS AES
- [ ] Mention password never leaves browser

**"What if Groq API is down?"**
- [ ] Show you're thinking: "We'd have error handling, show proper message to user, could add fallback service"

### Questions To Ask Them
- [ ] "What tech stack does your team use?"
- [ ] "What does a typical day look like?"
- [ ] "What's the biggest challenge your team is facing?"
- [ ] "How is performance measured/success measured?"
- [ ] "What's the code review process?"
- [ ] "What's the deployment process?"

### Closing (Last 2 minutes)
- [ ] Thank them: "Thank you so much for your time"
- [ ] Show enthusiasm: "I'm really excited about this opportunity"
- [ ] Ask about next steps: "What's the next step in the process?"

## ⚠️ THINGS THAT MIGHT GO WRONG - HOW TO HANDLE

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Laptop screen won't share | "One sec, let me try screen share... or I can walk you through while you look at my screen" |
| Demo code crashes | "Interesting, let me check... [open DevTools] Oh I see the issue - it's [X]" (shows debugging) |
| You freeze on a question | "That's a good question, give me a sec to think... [pause]... here's my approach..." |
| Your answer goes too long | Interviewer might ask "Does that make sense?" - That's your cue to wrap up |
| They ask about something you built | Direct them to the code: "Let me show you in `/components/Editor.jsx`" |
| They ask about something you didn't implement | "That's a feature I didn't prioritize in the MVP, but here's how I'd implement it..." |
| Your WiFi gets bad | Stay calm: "I'm having some connectivity issues, should I call back in 5?" |
| You make a mistake | "Actually, let me correct that - it should be [right answer]" |
