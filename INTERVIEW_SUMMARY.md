## 🚨 THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

❌ **Don't** claim features you didn't implement
- VersionHistory and GrammarChecker exist but may not be fully integrated
- Be honest: "I started building that but focused on core features"

❌ **Don't** overcomplicate answers
- Keep it simple first, then add complexity if asked

❌ **Don't** forget to mention localStorage limitations
- "This works great for MVP but wouldn't scale to 1M notes"

❌ **Don't** pretend to know about topics you don't
- "I haven't worked with that, but I learn quickly" is fine

❌ **Don't** spend >5 minutes on any one question
- If stuck, ask for clarification or hint

❌ **Don't** forget to show confidence in what you DID build
- You built a real, working application!

## 💡 IF YOU GET STUCK IN THE INTERVIEW

| Situation | What to say |
|-----------|------------|
| Don't know answer | "That's a great question. I haven't dealt with that yet, but let me think... I would probably..." |
| Can't remember code location | "Let me search for that... [use Ctrl+F in IDE] It's in `/context/NotesContext.jsx`" |
| Interviewer challenges your choice | "That's a fair point. At the time I chose X because of Y, but now that you mention it, Z would be better because..." |
| They ask about performance | "With my current approach, it works for ~100 notes. But for 1M notes, I'd need to..." |
| You make a mistake | "Good catch! I see the issue - actually it should be..." [correct yourself] |
| They ask you to code and you're stuck | "Let me think through this step by step... The issue is [explain], so the fix would be [explain]" |
